The resulting value will always be\n  between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,\n  depending on the number of coordinates given. The noise value can be\n  animated by moving through the noise space and the 2nd and 3rd\n  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.\n\n  The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in\n  respect to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept\n  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several\n  octaves which are added together for the final result.\n\n  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the\n  scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an\n  infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such,\n  only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when\n  using noise within a loop). As a general rule the smaller the\n  difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise\n  sequence will be.

This is useful with the default (or JAVA2D) renderer\n    setting, as it will improve font rendering speed.

When depth testing is disabled, items\n    will be drawn to the screen sequentially, like a painting. This\n    hint is most often used to draw in 3D, then draw in 2D on top of\n    it (for instance, to draw GUI controls in 2D on top of a 3D\n    interface).

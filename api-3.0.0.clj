If no size parameter is input, the font will appear at its\n  original size until it is changed with text-size.\n\n  Because fonts are usually bitmaped, you should create fonts at the\n  sizes that will be used most commonly. Using textFont without the\n  size parameter will result in the cleanest-looking text.\n\n  With the default (JAVA2D) and PDF renderers, it's also possible to\n  enable the use of native fonts via the command\n  (hint :enable-native-fonts). This will produce vector text in JAVA2D\n  sketches and PDF output in cases where the vector data is available:\n  when the font is still installed, or the font is created via the\n  create-font fn",

The resulting value will always be\n  between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,\n  depending on the number of coordinates given. The noise value can be\n  animated by moving through the noise space and the 2nd and 3rd\n  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.\n\n  The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in\n  respect to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept\n  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several\n  octaves which are added together for the final result.\n\n  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the\n  scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an\n  infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such,\n  only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when\n  using noise within a loop). As a general rule the smaller the\n  difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise\n  sequence will be.
